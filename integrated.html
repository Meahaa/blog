    <h2>Integrating Interfaces</h2>
    <h3>A personal exploration into understanding the dos and don'ts of integrated physical-digital interface design.</h3>
  </div>

      <h6>What are Integrated Interfaces?</h6>
      <p>With the advancement of technology, many consumer products are beginning to harness the power of using both digital and physical interfaces - or integrated interfaces. The integration of interaction design and industrial design can result in richer, deeper experiences. Unfortunately, when executed incorrectly, this integration can lead to confusion or even failure of product usability. It’s a major design challenge to determine how to define the boundary between physical and digital interfaces and which medium each task/scenario should employ. In many products, this combination is used ineffectively, or may not be necessary at all. In fact, it’s not uncommon to see designs using known physical or digital interface design guidelines improperly.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="constraints">
      <h6>Skeuomorphism</h6>
      <p>Skeuomorphism is a design methodology developed in the 80s in which an object in software mimics its real-life counterpart. This is a method that clearly harnesses the joint power of two design fields, where interaction design takes inspiration from industrial design to create digital affordances. Material design methodology uses many skeuomorphic elements in the design language. Skeuomorphism was extremely valuable in introducing digital usability patterns when digital interfaces were first released. Common examples are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Shadows around elements which are intended to be clickable</li>
        <li>The trashcan to indicate where deletion of files</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Although in the past, skeuomorphism had been slowly phased out and replaced with flat design methodologies, it has recently begun to regain popularity with the release of new and innovative technology. Internet of Things devices and wearables all seem to some degree, apply skeuomorphic techniques to their designs. The Nest Thermostat and the Apple Watch are good examples of skeuomorphic design being applied to help integrate physical and digital controls and products.</p>

      <h6>Benefits of Integrated Interfaces</h6>
      <ol>
        <li>Having digital and industrial design work together can create a unified digital-physical brand experience that acts across all interfaces is most impactful and memorable.</li>
        <li>Harnessing the knowledge and experience from two industries to create a richer, more fluid user experience.</li>
        <li>Historically, no further improvements can be made without significant retooling to a physical product after it’s released, but incorporating digital elements and the ability to update firmware allows for post-launch updates to be pushed out to customers. Interactive onboarding, introducing new features, and responding to customer feedback lead to increased customer engagement and brand advocacy.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="constraints">
      <h6>Negatives of Integrated Products</h6>
      <ol>
        <li>Using the real world to augment user experiences can result in clunky user experiences that bounce users. A well-designed physical product and a beautiful, usable digital interface can quickly fail people when either the physical or digital aspects have been developed without considering the other.</li>
        <li>Unnecessary additions: With the rapid development of technology, it sometimes seems as if digital interfaces may just be integrated since the technologically is available. This leads to the creation of products that do not have an integrated experience, but rather two separate experiences competing with each other.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h6>Design Takeaways</h6>
      <p>Because the functionality of each integrated product is so unique, it is difficult to develop a set of design standards to help designers create amazing joint physical and digital interfaces. Instead, I believe a set of recommendations on the approach to such problems, is more beneficial. These are as follows.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Research</b>: It is imperative that design research into both the physical and cognitive tolerances in context of the user’s environment is conducted. Equally and continuously throughout the design process. Too often designers will focus on one modality, when in integrated interfaces, consideration of both is crucial to success,</li>
        <li><b>Cross Functional Teams</b>: Diverse teams are critical to designing physical and digital experiences. Ensure that it is created together, not as siloed opportunities. Consistent and continuous, communication of ideas, assumptions and design decisions becomes even more important on these cross functional teams.</li>
        <li><b>Affordances</b>: Create affordances for both physical and digital interfaces, in their correct mode. Ensure that the affordances indicate which interface the user should interact with.</li>
        <li><b>Feedback</b>: Provide valuable feedback on system status of both the physical and digital interfaces. Ensure that feedback is provided in the proper modality, or both if it aligns with the users expectations.</li>
        <li><b>Models</b>: With the complexity of another layer in the interface, it is extremely important to align conceptual model with user’s mental model. Deep dives into the user's mental model of the system such as "how it should work", "how I think it works", etc. can prove invaluable when making design decisions.</li>
        <li><b>Workflow Analysis</b>: DO NOT add extra, unnecessary steps just to harness the power of both interfaces: ie. adding an app to turn on your lights: 1. Switch, 2. Pull out phone, unlock phone, open app, turn on lights</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="constraints">
      <h6>Application: Internet Of Things</h6>
      <p>Internet of Things (IoT) devices rely heavily on the interface between the physical and digital world, this could be why it has become so difficult to integrate many of these devices into our lives. These take many items of processes in the home and have added a digitized, controllable component (typically from a mobile or desktop interface). Taking physical objects that have been designed and refined over centuries, and adding an additional layer of technology to provide a wider set of functionality. While some of these devices have been praised for their design ingenuity (such as Nest Thermostats), others have quickly lead to failure due to the complexity of their control systems and poor design of their interfaces. In order to apply the skills and knowledge I have learnt studying integrated interfaces, I will design a simple IoT device (ignoring potential technical limitation): the refrigerator.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="constraints">
      <h6>Design: IoT Fridge</h6>
      <p>It is important to note that I am not trying to drastically change or alter the current functions of a fridge. Instead, I'm aiming - like most integrated devices - to add additional functionality to the product. This additional functionality is meant to ease some of the burdens a user may typically have with this common household appliance, or add additional features that could make the experience richer. In order to incorporate a digital display without drastically altering the controls of the fridge, it will sit within the door of the fridge at eye-level and within the comfortable reach of the average population height. The controls of the fridge will be as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Light</b>: The light control will remain in the fridge as with the current fridge design. It doesn't make sense to make this control control digital since it is only accessed when the fridge is open, and the display is out of reach.</li>
        <div class="size">
          <img src="images/iot1.png" class="full_image border">
          <h5 class="caption">When screen is OFF</h5>
        </div>
        <li><b>Time:</b> When in any household, it's always convenient to have the time located in many places. In kitchens, this can typically be found on ovens, microwaves and stoves. Having an additional device tell you time (and date) could provide useful information to users. When not in use the screen on the fridge will display time and date (see above). When motion of the door is detected or proximity of a person, the display will activate .</li>
        <div class="size">
          <img src="images/iot3.png" class="full_image border">
          <h5 class="caption">Alert if fridge/freezer is open too long</h5>
        </div>
        <li><b>Energy consumption</b>: Many IoT products such as lights and heating systems display energy consumption statistics to assist users in making environmentally friendly decisions. While initially, I included this feature as part of the interface, I realized that this case is very different than other household appliances. Unlike heating/cooling systems or lights in the home, the temperature of the fridge does not change based on user preference, but is set based on the contents of the appliance, and couldn't really change based on energy consumption patterns. Instead, to conserve energy, the digital display can have both a visual and audible alert to warn you if the fridge/freezer has not been properly closed/is open too long.</li>
        <div class="size">
          <img src="images/iot2.png" class="full_image border">
          <h5 class="caption">Display</h5>
        </div>
        <li><b>Temperature</b>: Designing the temperature controls was a difficult process for me. As a primary control in the fridge it's important to ensure that it was easily accessible and in the correct mode. It would be confusing to have it available in both physical and digital interfaces, but it was difficult to know if matching the current standard of physical controls, or moving to easier to use digital controls would be more valuable. Since current physical controls are often confusing, and difficult to locate, it seemed the better choice to make the controls and information digital, and easily accessible in the display. To change the temperature, users would need to confirm in order to prevent accidental clicks on the interface from affecting the temperature of the appliance.</li>
        <li><b>Reminders</b>: "Replace the light.", "Change the water filter." "You're low on eggs" are all digital reminders that currently rely on users memory. The digital interface could provide this information to users alleviating some of the cognitive workload. Additionally, users could have the option to connect their fridge to a mobile app in true IoT fashion (depending on users desires this should be optional) to access this information remotely, such as when they are grocery shopping.</li>
        <li><b>Notes</b>: People often have small notes/reminders around their kitchen, sometimes even stuck to the fridge. Taking inspiration from that behavior, I've integrated a notes section into the interface for users to create reminders, notes and maybe even events. Similar to reminders, it would be ideal to be able to set and see these from an app so they are accessible remotely.</li>
        <li><b>Capacity</b>: Indicating how much space remains in your fridge can help users when they are grocery shopping to determine the volume of food they should buy. It can help with organization of the fridge and does not rely on user memory, but rather sensors with the appliance itself.
