    <h2>Design for Trust</h2>
    <h3>A exploration into how designers can harness the power of trust in their products.</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="slim">
    <div class="constraints">
      <h6>What is Trust?</h6>
      <p>There is no universally accepted definition of trust. The lack of agreement on this topic could be attributed to the different fields researching the topic. A disciplinary lens often skews perspective and causes psychologists to see trust as a personal trait, sociologists to see trust as a social structure, and economists to see trust as an economic choice mechanism. In the eyes of the designer, trust isn’t clearly defined, but is a tool often used in digital products. When looking at interfaces it’s clear that trust isn’t binary, but rather a spectrum of different flavors. Different products require and aim to have different forms or strength of trusts between their products. Trust in an email subscription, trust in a news source, trust in a payment service or even trusting that a device shows the correct time are all experiences that design for trust, and yet create complete different relationships between users and products. One common theme, is that you put trust in a product when it can put you in a position of vulnerability. The consequences of this vulnerability are what create the spectrum and genre of trust.</p>

      <h6>Why do you need trust?</h6>
      <p>Inherently it may seem that every interface requires some degree of trust. Digital products and services are in the business of information sharing and collection - all interfaces communicate some form of information to the users. If this information can’t be trusted the interface is rendered useless. More interesting than the existence of trust in digital products, is situations where products would fail due to lack of trust. Think of a situation where you have left a user funnel due to lack of trust in an interface: you didn’t share your email or name, didn’t input your credit card number or didn’t download that highly suspicious file. These are all situations where a lack of trust in the interface has led to ultimate failure of the product. This failure can directly affect conversion rates, engagement, adoption and other metrics that typically directly define success. </p>

    <div class="constraints">
      <h6>Building Trust</h6>
      <p>Research into trust has exponentially increased with the rapid expansion of information systems. Many papers attempt to define the constructs of trust, or the characteristics that can foster trust. These differ from field to field, but some commonality exists between these. While this trust is typically interpersonal, some of these constructs can help establish design patterns that also help build trust between user and interface.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Familiarity/Predictability</b>: The more different or unfamiliar something/someone is, the harder it is to trust. When anything behaves in an unexpected manner, people are often quick to be suspicious. Unexpected behavior or results often create an initial sense of wariness that creates a barrier to overcome.</li>
        <li><b>Competence/Credibility</b>: This can be established through interactions, reputation, history, etc. Credibility does not necessarily need to come from an official source, and could simple be provided by social proof</li>
        <li><b>Honesty/Integrity</b>: These much more intangible, almost emotional constructs are often determine very subjectively. Determining whether an individual is honest/has integrity often is a decision making process, easily influenced by the typical cognitive biases.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="problem">
        <p>Can you rebuild trust if it has been broken? Building trust from a neutral standpoint is not as difficult as mending a break in trust. Overcoming this barrier can sometimes prove to be insurmountable, particularly through interface design alone. This is one of the few reasons why it’s so important to design trust into your product from the get go.</p>

      <h6>Design Takeaways</h6>
      <p>In product design, there exists a constant battle between the reward for completing an action, and the work required to receive it. Think of trust as another tool designed can use to overcome this hurdle. Below are the considerations that should be taken into account to help you design for trust.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Social Proof</b>: This can come in the form of testimonials, friend recommendations or word-of-mouth. Incorporating the human aspect into your design, and building this community can really establish trust in your design. Airbnb and Stanford puclished research proving that reputation can help people overcome barriers to trust in situations where a user might not otherwise proceed.</li>
        <li><b>Certification</b>: This is a little harder to accomplish in the digital age, but having certifications of excellence or verifications of authenticities can help build trust in your designs. Verified payment services are a prime example of this.</li>

        <h5 class="caption">Online Certifications to prove authenticity</h5>
        <li><b>Brand</b>: a marketing tool that has been used since the analogue age, the brand of the product strongly influences not only the reputation, but the emotional response and decisions making process of a user. Imagery, color and copy can influence the feeling of trust that your brand invokes.</li>
        <li><b>User Centered Design</b>: Making it seem as if the product aims to protect the user is a key feature that can help establish trust. The sense of focusing on the user goals and needs, and prioritizing this over company goals often helps establish a positive trust relationship.</li>
        <li><b>Layout</b>: No overwhelming or hidden information that looks as if it is trying to hide. Make it clear what you are trying to offer, making it easy for users to learn more and discover if they so choose. Hiding key information as smaller, hidden below the fold, under carousels or in hidden elements can reduce trust.</li>
        <li><b>Sensitive Information Treatment</b>: Complete transparency is important, acknowledgement of the sensitivity of the information and shown steps on how this is being treated</li>
        <img src="images/sensitive.png" class="full_image">
        <h5 class="caption">Stripe Protection of User Data </h5>
        <li><b>Context</b>: This is extremely important when building trust in a product. Confusing experiences and relevance of provided information can severely decrease a user's trust. Trust is often decided based on previous experiences of the user, so an understanding of their context can help designers create products that users can relate to.</li>
        <li><b>Expectations</b>: when users expectations are not met, leads to automatic distrust in a product or service. Even when it is the user experience itself, be it the user funnel/journey, an unexpected event can lead to an unpleasant experience. </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="constraints">
      <h6>Ethics</h6>
      <p>Viruses, scams or even catfishing are all cases of online fraud that are unanimously malicious.  The existence of these threats has created a need for businesses to develop an artificial trust between user and product. As a designer, it is important to recognize the influence designing for trust can have on users. Think critically about the implications of creating a product that builds trust, and how that trust is being manipulated. A prime example of this manipulation is in user data acquisition. A major point of contention between individuals and businesses has been the analysis and sale of personal data. When users provide their data to a business upon signup, there is typically an implict sense of trust in the product. Take care to ensure that users' are aware and informed, and do not use their trust to manipulate their decisions in an unethical manner. This can be applied to a variety of products and services - particularly to online pyramid schemes and subscriptions.

      <h6>Case Study: Airbnb & Getaround</h6>
      <p><a href="https://www.airbnb.ca/?locale=en">Airbnb</a> is an industry leader in designing for trust. In fact, this is one of the biggest challenges they face in the design of their product. They must inherently build trust not only between the service and the user, but also between the users' as well. With this in mind, Airbnb has created a product that fosters both trust and community. Looking at their web application, it is easy to see how they are applying good design for trust methodologies to engage their users.</p>

      <p>For proof of their excellence, look at all the another businesses that mimic the Airbnb model: <a href="https://www.getaround.com/">Getaround</a>. Their service is very comparable to Airbnb where trust is a necessity in their product.</p>

        </div>
        <li><b>Brand</b>: One of the perils of a younger company is a lack of effort and resrouces invested in developing a brand. For many companies, this (rightfully so) takes a back seat to the development of a functional product. However, when engagement with your product depends on your brand, its often important to consider both during development. </li>
