    <h2>Design for International</h2>
    <h3>A personal exploration into understanding the purpose, benefits and design guidelines of localization, and why it's been so successful.</h3>

      <h6>What is Global Design?</h6>
      <p>The rapid spread of online commerce has created an opportunity to open up digital markets and products to the international community. This also creates increased competition for your products, and a resulting need to make sure your brand can reach citizens in all languages and cultures. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="constraints">
      <h6>Narrow Field of View</h6>
      <p>Living in a specific region, it’s easy to assume that your cultures design standards are glocal design standards, particularly in the english speaking world. As a result the majority of the internet's pages and market places are primarily in english. Some factors such as programming languages or the shortage of typographers in foreign languages could ocntribute to this problem. 
      But often, this result sin designs that focus on the english speaking world, with the western world receiving a lot of attention. In order to design an accessible product, it’s important to recognize the influence of culture and language in design.</p>

      <h6>Hofstede’s Cultural Dimension Theory </h6>
      <p>While there has been a lot of research around cultural differences, not many have been as widespread as Geert Hofstede’s work. According to Hofstede (1980), world cultures vary across certain consistent and fundamental values or dimensions. These 5 dimensions are as follows.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Power Distance</b>: the extent to which the powerful accept equal power distribution</li>
        <li><b>Collectivism vs. Individualism</b>: the degree to which individuals are integrated into groups, with emphasis on personal/individual succes or group affiliation/loyalty</li>
        <li><b>Femininity vs. Masculinity</b>: the distribution of emotional roles between genders. Masculine cultures are competitive, assertive, materialistic and feminine value relationships and quality of life</li>
        <li><b>Uncertainty Avoidance:</b>: the degree of avoidance of uncertainty and ambiguity. High Avoidance cultures are more emotional, and control with regulations. Low Avoidance cultures are more pragmatic with less regulation.</li>
        <li><b>Long vs. Short-Term Orientation</b>: the time horizon of the society. Long term are future oriented, pragmatic rewarding persistence and saving and short term cultures focus on the present rewarding social relations .</li>
      </ul>
      <p>While these dimensions were created in an attempt to decipher cultural values from a sociological perspective, the insights his systematic framework provide into cultural norms are extremely valuable and applicable to design.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="constraints">
      <h6>Localization</h6>
      <p>Localization refers to the adaptation of a product, application or document content to meet the language, cultural and other requirements of a specific target market (a locale). This places an emphasis on considering user context in the design process, specifically looking into their cultural demographic. The level of localization can be considered a spectrum, where on one end there is the bare minimum of translations, and on the other a completely different site. There are advantages and disadvantages to both.</p>
      <div class="problem">
        <p>Side note: globalization is not the same as localization! While often confused, globalization refers to the design of a _____ . Localization refers to customizing the content and layout of a site to cater to distinct locales.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="constraints">
      <h6>Standardization</h6>
      <p>While often confused with localization, standardization is a method of localization. This is the design of a global template - one design that can be modified to fit cultural norms while still preserving consistent high level design features (navigation, layout). Global templates make switching between  different countires less disruptive, and results in a homogeneous online culture that could  break down barriers and make one international market place. To do this its importnat to plan for variations in cultures by creating neutral templates with moving parts i.e. images, icons, copy (Modular or atomic design). Getting input from different cultures is extremely important, and layouts should be adaptabel to any country. A prime example of this method in place is Facebook.</p>

      <h6>Transcreation</h6>
      <p>Transcreation, the process of adapting your brand’s identity and message for different cultures and audiences. This is extremely important as different groups react differently to various symbols, messages, cues and even colours. Applied to all areas of design, this is creating completely distinct designs for each locale. The objective is to evoke the same emotions, messages and brand identity through different cultural cues and relationships. While this typically results in higher engagement and conversion, it can be extraordinarily expensive and often results in the company’s different locales working in segregation. The process of designing with this methodology is to treat each individual locale as their own distinct project. A more in depth analysis of this in action can be seen in the case study below </p>
    </div>
    <div class="constraints">
    <h6>Design Takeaways</h6>
    <p>While there isn't any agreement as to the benefit of transcreation or standardization, there are some general guidelines that can help designers address their diverse user base.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><u>Language</u>: A distinctive aspect of different cultures, which when moved to the online domain presents its own challenges of quality of translation, representation and stylistic elements</li>
    </ul>
