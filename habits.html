    <h2>Habit Forming Design</h2>
    <h3>A personal exploration into understanding the psychology of habits and how these theories can be used or are already used in design.</h3>

      <h6>What is habit forming design?</h6>
      <p>Taking inspiration from both persuasive and behaviour design, habit forming design seems to specifially target the creation or manipulation of an individuals habits. Where it gets confusing, is what specifically defines a habit? Could a one time conversion be counted as a habit? It is an action? A thought? An emotion? To truly understand how to design for habits, its important to understand what and how habits are formed and influenced.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="constraints">
      <h6>The Habit Loop</h6>
      <p>While there are many different phsycological models for habits, they all seem to include similar themes. A habit is a multi-step cyclical process. This means that for an behavior to be considered a habit, it must complete the entire process. Charles Duhigg's habit loop includes three major steps: Trigger, Routine and Reward.
      </p>
      <div class="problem">
        <p>Charles Duhigg is a celebrated psychologist and anthropologist who created the Habit Loop and shared his findings in a great novel <a href="http://charlesduhigg.com/the-power-of-habit/">The Power of Habit</a>. If you're interested in learning more, I highly recommend this read!</p>

      <h6>The Hook Model</h6>
      <p>To help develop the site objectives, I helped create a set of detailed personas. These personas would ideally assist in identifying the pain points in the current site as well as act as guiding principles for future designs. Using Gap's consumer insights, these personas included the shoppers' behaviour on the site and personality attributes. We focused on how different personas approached online shopping on BananaRepublic.com, and questioned everything from their brand loyalty to the devices they used to engage with the brand.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="constraints">
      <h6>Design Takeways</h6>
      <p>With insights in hand, I helped identify the pain points for each user and prioritized them against Banana Republic's business and design goals. Once pain points were established, the team created a clear statement indicating the high level problem(s) that needed to be solved. These six problem statements aligned the Design and UX teams so that we could begin to ideate and explore possible solutions. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="constraints">
      <h6>Ethics</h6>
        <p>The goal of this exercise was to tackle the big problems together and build a hypothesis of what might work. The end result was a list potential solutions with a description of the problem whey were solving, and an overall idea of how to test and validate these assumptions. These sketches were organized by importance to Banana Republic and Gap, and categorized based on which pain point they addressed. While not explicitly stated as a solution, creating a responsive site was still a major objective in this project.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="constraints">
        <h6>Application</h6>
      <p>After collaboratively deciding which hypothesis were the most valuable, the features were all prototyped at different levels of fidelity. While all the features were prototyped to some degree of fidelity, the high priority features were fully built in Axure. I then personally created the final prototype in HTML/CSS to showcase the new interactivity and responsiveness of the site.
