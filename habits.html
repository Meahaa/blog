      <h2>Habit Forming Design</h2>
      <h3>A personal exploration into understanding the psychology of habits and how these theories can be used or are already used in design.</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="slim">
      <div class="constraints">
        <h6>What is habit forming design?</h6>
        <p>Persuasive design seems to be synonymous with behaviour design where habit forming design is a sub-topic in behaviour design. Historically, it seems that designers moved away from using “persuasion” in their vocabulary to define user/product goals, and instead used “behaviour design” with both having the same goal of designing to change people’s beliefs or behaviours.</p>
        <p>When we look at habit forming design were looking at any aspect of changing or creating a habit cycle or routine in a user’s life. This can include anything from getting a user to engage with a product as part of their routine or using the product to influence another habit in their life. It can be used for business objectives such as conversion or daily active users, or even for quitting smoking or improving physical health</p>

        <h6>Industry Research</h6>
        <p>In order to help identify the shortcomings of the BR site, extensive market research was conducted to identify the success and failures of other industry competitors. It was during this preliminary stage of the project where we realized that BR did not have a clear objective for this redesign, nor guiding goals or design principles for their site.</p>
        <img src="images/brol1test.png" class="full_image">
        <h5 class="caption">Industry Research</h5>
        <div class="problem">
          <p>The ambiguity of the design problem first became clear to me during this research phase. The BR and Gap teams couldn't seem to agree on what in the site should or could be changed or why. From preliminary discussions, Sequence assumed it would be more layout and content changes, however as the project progressed it became a much more involved redesign.

        <h6>Personas</h6>
        <p>To help develop the site objectives, I helped create a set of detailed personas. These personas would ideally assist in identifying the pain points in the current site as well as act as guiding principles for future designs. Using Gap's consumer insights, these personas included the shoppers' behaviour on the site and personality attributes. We focused on how different personas approached online shopping on BananaRepublic.com, and questioned everything from their brand loyalty to the devices they used to engage with the brand.</p>
        </ul>
        <img src="images/brol_personas.png" class="full_image">
        <h5 class="caption">Banana Republic online shopper personas</h5>
        <p>These personas helped guide the team in ideation of future features. <i>"Is this for her?"</i> became a guiding mantra in prioritizing new features.</p>
        <div class="problem">
          <p>Designing for these very conflicting personas was a big challenge. They're ideal experiences often clashed creating the necessity for categorizing their importance to the brand. This prioritization took into account their actual and likelihood of purchasing as well as willingness to push through a un-optimized experience.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="constraints">
        <h6>Pain Points</h6>
        <p>With insights in hand, I helped identify the pain points for each user and prioritized them against Banana Republic's business and design goals. Once pain points were established, the team created a clear statement indicating the high level problem(s) that needed to be solved. These six problem statements aligned the Design and UX teams so that we could begin to ideate and explore possible solutions. </p>

      </div>
      <div class="constraints">
        <h6>Ideation</h6>
        <p>The goal of this exercise was to tackle the big problems together and build a hypothesis of what might work. The end result was a list potential solutions with a description of the problem whey were solving, and an overall idea of how to test and validate these assumptions. These sketches were organized by importance to Banana Republic and Gap, and categorized based on which pain point they addressed. While not explicitly stated as a solution, creating a responsive site was still a major objective in this project.</p>

        <h5 class="caption">Banana Republic Proposed Features</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="constraints">
        <h6>Experimentation</h6>
        <p>After collaboratively deciding which hypothesis were the most valuable, the features were all prototyped at different levels of fidelity. While all the features were prototyped to some degree of fidelity, the high priority features were fully built in Axure. I then personally created the final prototype in HTML/CSS to showcase the new interactivity and responsiveness of the site.
          <img src="images/brolscreenshot.png" class=" full_image">
          <div class="problem">
            <p>Although we initially wanted to create the entire prototype in Axure (since many of the features had been iteratively developed throughout the ideation phase), the software could not demonstrate the full benefits of the new responsive design. With the knowledge that BR needed some assistance if understanding the value of a truly responsive site, I proposed we make a fully functioning, HTML/CSS prototype. This was the first time Sequence delivered a fully developed prototype to a client.</p>

    <div class=" constraints">
      <h6>Deliverables</h6>
      <p>Since Gap has a very strict guidelines for testing user facing products, the validation of these features was beyond the scope of this project. In order to ensure the effectiveness of this redesign, I helped consolidate the knowledge and findings from this project so that the Banana Republic team could continue iteratively developing the features for the site. Thus, the final deliverables for BR included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> A process book for approaching design and testing</li>
        <li> Specifications for a fully responsive website</li>
        <li> A working HTML prototype that models responsive behavior across devices</li>
      </ul>

      <h6>Next Steps</h6>
      <p>User testing helps us validate or disprove our proposed design solutions. For the Banana Republic team, this meant testing the prototype in the Gap Research Lab. In the final deliverable, Sequence outlined some testing procedure recommendations. Specifically, after testing is complete, it is necessary to continue refining any lingering pain points that were not resolved. This process should be repeated until the problems were resolved.</p>

    <div class="constraints">
      <h6>Results</h6>
      <p>While browsing the BR store last week, I noticed that some of the features I designed have been implemented into the website. These include, but are not limited to, the mobile sales drawer, mid-page visual navigation and mobile navigation.</p>
